GoBalloon
=========

High Altitude Balloon payload controller in Go.   The base directory is only a shell, currently.   Most of the work so far has been on the AX.25 and APRS libraries.   AX.25/KISS receive and send is currently functional, as is the encoding of compressed position and telemetry packets.   More to follow.
